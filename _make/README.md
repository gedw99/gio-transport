# makefiles

These makefile includes follow certain conventions to:

- Ensure CI and Local Dev work the same.
- Provide conventions that are extensible.

## Examples

[examples/gioui__gio-example](examples/gioui__gio-example) is an example project to try.

## Conventions

There are some conventions in all this that you can follow to stay out of trouble.

### Naming of targets 

Use a Prefix to isolate each make target of each makefile respectively.

For example:

In [go.mk](go.mk), you have ```go-build```, ```go-run```, etc

in [git.mk](git.mk) you have ```git-repo-clone-origin```, ```git-repo-clone-upstream```, etc


### prefix-print ###

Each makefile include has a ```<prefix>-print``` echo's the used variables back to you.

During CI, it will audit trail the builds.

During local, it helps with configuring the variables in your root makefile.

For example:

In [go.mk](go.mk), you have the following variables:
- ```GO_OS```
- ```GO_EX```
- ```GO_BIN_FSPATH```
- ```GO_BIN_NAME```


In [gio.mk](gio.mk), you have the following variables:
- ```GIO_EX_PATH```
- ```GIO_EX_NAME```

### prefix-dep ###

Each make file includes has a ```<prefix>-dep``` that ensures any dependency it has are installed.

This ensures both CI and Local Dev always have the dependencies and they are the same in each environment.

For example in [gio.mk](gio.mk), it will ensure that the gogio compile tool is installed. The version can be reflected from the go.modules per project.
